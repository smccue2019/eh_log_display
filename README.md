Matlab scripts to ingest, display, and save serial output from an eH sensor.
Measurements are shown individually as text and plotted in time.

I do not know whether the code captured here is what was sent to sea with J
Seewald and S Silva. It was a rushed, last minute project developed on an
unnetworked laptop. I do think it's likely the same as they claimed worked
well at sea.

June 2017. Developed and used at sea. Uploaded to Bitbucket as an Hg repo.
Dec 2019. Converted to git.
